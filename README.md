I wanted to start learning some web automation and web development so I came up with the idea of a website that generates python bots. I used Selenium and 
SeleniumBase for the bot and bootstrap as the css framework. The main idea is a bot that attends a google meeting for you, you only have to fill out the form in the
website and the bot is automatically generated for you and download-ready.Unfortunately, I did not have the time to add the back-end to my website, that is, a proper 
server. If I were to update this project, the next features to implement would be: 
 - create a server 
 - generate a downloadable executable file from the server that includes dependencies
 - add extra security to the website
